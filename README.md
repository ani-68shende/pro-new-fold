# Live Crypto Prices Tracker (Javascript, React.js, API, Axios)

### Built a Live crypto Tracker which shows the current changes in the value of different crypto currencies and I have also deployed it on the internet. 

### I have used the axios which is a Javascript library used to make HTTP requests from the browser.

## Demo of the website: https://live-crypto-updates.herokuapp.com
